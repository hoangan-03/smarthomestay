Smart Homestay is considered a model that is somewhat similar to Smart Home - a model of a house with smart IoT devices to support human life. However, with Smart Homestay, this is a model applied to households participating in homestay projects to develop tourism. Or simply put, Smart Homestay, in addition to acting as a smart home management system, also supports homeowners in managing guests who come to travel and stay at their home.

Specifically, in this project, we will use multiple hardware devices and connect them to a central management system. The house will be monitored for light levels, humidity, and ambient temperature. The system will store information and control the on/off of devices to suit the environmental conditions at that time. In addition, as presented, the system also supports the homeowner with an interface that allows them to mark the homestay booking schedule of customers for the convenience of serving tourism.
